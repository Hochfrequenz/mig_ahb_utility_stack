| This repository contains the Python package ``maus``.
| MAUS is an acronym for **M**\ IG **A**\ HB **U**\ tility **S**\ tack where MIG stands for **M**\ essage **I**\ mplementation **G**\ uide and AHB stands for **A**\ nwendungs\ **h**\ and\ **b**\ uch.
| The maus package allows matching single lines from the AHB with fields specified in the MIG.
| This package is necessary because EDI\@Energy does not provide any real technical and machine-readable description of the MIGs and AHBs, only PDFs.

We're all hoping for the day of true digitization on which this repository will become obsolete.

What Problem Does It Solve?
---------------------------
Image you scraped the AHB PDFs into something machine-readable.
Machine-readability in this context implies, that for each field/information inside the AHB you can easily access

- segment group (e.g. "``SG4``")
- segment (e.g. "``LOC``")
- data element ID (e.g. "``3225``")
- AHB Expressions (e.g. "``Muss [123] U ([456] O [789])[904]``")

The exact data format (be it CSV, JSON, XML ...) is not important beyond an initial deserialization.

(BTW: The AHB Expression can be parsed and evaluated using the `ü¶Ö AHBicht Library <https://github.com/Hochfrequenz/ahbicht>`__ or our AHBicht REST API which is publicly available.)

Image you also had a machine-readable version of the MIG -- spoiler: Hochfrequenz can help you with that (please contact
`@JoschaMetze <https://github.com/joschametze>`_ for a demo) -- you still weren't able to make use of your data because the MIG data and AHB data are still unrelated.
MAUS creates a connection between machine readable AHBs and machine readable MIGs.
This allows to associate certain lines from the AHB with certain fields in the MIG and is the basis for a meaningful content evaluation/validation of EDIFACT messages, or, to be more precise, validation of data structures that might be converted to EDIFACT.

Code Quality / Production Readiness
-----------------------------------

-  The code has at least a 95% unit test coverage. ‚úîÔ∏è
-  The code is rated 10/10 in pylint and type checked with mypy (PEP 561). ‚úîÔ∏è
-  The code is `MIT licensed <LICENSE>`__. ‚úîÔ∏è
-  There are only `few dependencies <requirements.in>`__. ‚úîÔ∏è

Development
-----------

Please follow the detailed instructions in the `README of our Python
Template
Repository <https://github.com/Hochfrequenz/python_template_repository#how-to-use-this-repository-on-your-machine>`__
on how to setup your local development environment (tl;dr: tox).
